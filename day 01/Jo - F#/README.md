# Getting started with F#

Those magical ```.fsx``` files are F# script files.
You can open them in a good old Visual Studio IDE, select the code you want to execute and press ALT+ENTER.

For those of you lucky enough to NOT have Visual Studio installed, there are alternatives on how to work with F# code. Please consult [fsharpforfunandprofit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/installing-and-using/).
